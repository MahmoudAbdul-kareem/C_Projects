# ATM Simulation

This project simulates an ATM machine with basic functionalities such as balance checking, cash withdrawal, and cash deposition. The user needs to authenticate with a password to access these functionalities. The number of password attempts can be controlled through the `PASS_VALID_TRY` macro defined in the `atm.h` file.

## Features

1. **Login with Authentication**
    - The user has up to three attempts to authenticate. The number of attempts can be controlled using the `PASS_VALID_TRY` macro.
    - After three unsuccessful attempts, the system exits.

2. **Balance Checking**
    - Allows the user to check their account balance.

3. **Cash Withdrawal**
    - Enables the user to withdraw a specified amount of money from their account.

4. **Cash Deposition**
    - Enables the user to deposit a specified amount of money into their account.
